    - title: Master's Project - Learnable quantisation through paramaterised companding functions.
      year: 2024
      description: Through learnable quantisation, I was able to halve the area footprint of LUT-based neural networks whilst improving network accuracy.
                   I developed a novel way to train a non-standard data representation through backpropgation of the network loss. This allowed layers to use
                   non-standard data formats which were directly optimised for the task, resulting in lower area and power consumption.
                   
    - title: Hardware-based mixed-format arithmetic accelerator 
      year: 2023
      description: Designed an arithmetic accelerator deployed on an FPGA to accelerate computations written in C.
                   This was an exploratory project in which the designs were iterated and optimised for timing and area.
                   The final design incorporated DMA accesses and a custom hardware block including a CORDIC implementation.
    - title: ProPutter
      year: 2023
      description: Built an embedded system deployed on a microprocessor which, when mounted on a golf putter, would take measurements
                   of the user's putt, and provide feedback on the user's performance via a web-app. This project involved optimising the
                   design for latency and memory usage.
    - title: Synth-Starter
      year: 2022
      description: Built an embedded system deployed on a real-time operating system, which collated information from multiple nodes in a wired network and
                   distributed commands to enable the nodes to play music in sync. This project involved developing custom protocols for communication
                   between nodes and optimising said protocols for latency and bandwidth. I explored thread-safe design practices and how to manage
                   a distributed system with hardware constraints.
